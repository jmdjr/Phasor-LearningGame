            <p>This page will update periodically as I make some progress on a sample game using the Phaser.js Game Engine.</p>

            <p>Here will be the Canvas based game, I don't know what I want to do at this point... maybe make a simple side scrolling platformer... a minimum viable product example.  Wish me luck!</p>
                <p>First Canvas example:</p>
                Comming Soon!

                <p>ok... so nothing as of right now... But, I do have a solid idea now! <br/>
                    the following image is a rough sketch of my aim (I am no artist)
                </p>
                <img src="images/Phasor-Game.png" style="width: 100%;padding: 0px;" />

                <p> the arrows show the basics for the physics involved. The idea is a
                    kind of paddle and ball game.  the ball will bounce on the paddle,
                    and the paddle will be draggable so that you can fling the ball
                    into the air.  there are three areas on the paddle on which you can
                    drag.  This is for me, since I currently don't know enough about
                    Phaser to know whether or not I can properly drag this paddle and
                    have it react the way I want it to react. </p>
            
            <p>The physics would probably be the first thing I will nail down.
                Once all the bouncing is finished, I will get the camera to focus
                on the ball.  This will be a kind of "see how high you can bounce
                the ball" game, to start.  I have some ideas for other things, but 
                for now, this is my minimum product for the weekend.</p>
            <p>To be continued...</p>

            <h3 id="Developent-beginning">Development: The beginning...</h3>
            <p>Date: 1/30/2015 4:30pm</p>
            
                <p>
                    By development, I mean programming... so I am going to be researching into how to structure a phaser game.  I have found several examples on their examples page that I want to use as reference for my starting project. I will include links once I have figured out which ones I want to use.
                </p>
                
                <p>So here is the initial list:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="http://docs.phaser.io/" target="_blank">Phaser.io Documentation</a></li>
                    <li><a href="http://examples.phaser.io/_site/view_full.html?d=arcade%20physics&f=gravity.js&t=gravity" target="_blank">Example: gravity</a></li>
                    <li><a href="http://examples.phaser.io/_site/view_full.html?d=arcade%20physics&f=launcher+follow+world.js&t=launcher%20follow%20world" target="_blank">Example: Launching and camera follow.</a></li>
                    <li>and a little flair if I have time: <a href="http://examples.phaser.io/_site/view_full.html?d=particles&f=tweened+emitter.js&t=tweened%20emitter" target="_blank">Example Particle emitting trailing objects</a></li>
                    <li><a href="http://examples.phaser.io/_site/view_full.html?d=arcade%20physics&f=sprite+vs+sprite.js&t=sprite%20vs%20sprite" target="_blank">Example: two sprites colliding</a></li>
                </ul>
                
                Here we go... here is the first actual version. (if your currently seeing this... yea, it looks silly but its a small milestone.)

            </section>
            <h3 id="Developent-progress">Development: Making Mistakes and Progress</h3>
            <section> 
                <p>Date: 1/30/2015 6:00pm</p>
                <p>Well, that went well.  but its not as flexible as I need it to be.  most of the functionality that is in the ARCADE physics engine is very fast, yes, but not as dynamic as I envision. after more research I found that the P2 engine is more up my alley.  So I will attempt to keep the first project up and start on a new game system using the P2 engine.</p>
                <p> bellow are my new references:</p>
                <ul>
                <li><a href="http://examples.phaser.io/_site/view_full.html?d=p2%20physics&f=gravity.js&t=gravity" target="_blank">Example: Gravity</a></li>
                    <li><a href="http://examples.phaser.io/_site/view_full.html?d=p2%20physics&f=body+click.js&t=body%20click" target="_blank">Example: User Input</a></li>
                    <li><a href="http://examples.phaser.io/_site/view_full.html?d=p2%20physics&f=remove+spring.js&t=remove%20spring" target="_blank">Example: Springs and more Input</a></li>
                    <li><a href="http://examples.phaser.io/_site/view_full.html?d=p2%20physics&f=mouse+spring.js&t=mouse%20spring" target="_blank">Example: Springs and Mouse Input</a></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Here is the next attempt at the same game, different physics engine:</p>
                <div id="game-P2"></div>
                <p>It works! well... that was a little too easy... Its late, and I have a load of new ideas for this little game.  tomorrow I will tackle a couple issues, like how the pulling is always happening from the center... (the paddle is supposed to tilt a little) and how there are collisions in the corners.  the paddle should stop right there, but sometimes it moves over its springs and can trap the ball under itself.</p>
                <p>Until tomorrow!</p>

            <section>
                <h3 id="Debugging-BugFix">Debugging: Bug Fixes and Enhancements</h3>
                <p>Date: 1/31/2015 12:00pm</p>
                <p>More references:</p>
                <ul>

                </ul>
                <p> so far I have made a good deal of progress, but I think I have so much farther to go in this engine... there is so much potential! So for this section, I am going to run through and try to improve the original attmepts by putting a pause screen on them, so that you can observe each one individually.  I am also going to generate another script for the polishing version.</p>
                <p> As the name suggests, this polishing section will be me cleaning up the code, but I will be writting the cleaner code in a separate file... So we can see each phase as I made them.  Once I am done, I will display and explain my code so that I can put this whole thing in perspective.  I may also return to each section and add code details and explain my thoughts.</p>
                <p>Here is today's Build:</p>
                <div id="game-polish"></div>
                <p>So I decided to grab a new texture for the ball... still learning this engine and its kind of getting in the way of the javascript sometimes.  I am sure my code is not very clean, since I am pulling references from here and there.</p>
                
                <p>Got caught up in some personal activities, and didn't get much more done, but this one is nice.  I may get a chance to display some of the code here in a bit, but its late again... just note that the hit  rectangle for the paddle appears to shift up almost a whole paddle height when the ball returns.  this makes it a little awkward when trying again, or maybe its a feature and you use it to get the ball higher! I also finally got a particle emitter going so the ball has a neat tail while it travels.  </p>
