            <h3>Welcome to JmdJR's First Phaser Game!</h3>
          
            <p> First let me point out... I <em>MISSPELLED</em> the engine's name when I generated this repository... my bad. </p>
            <p>This page will update periodically as I make some progress on a sample game using the Phaser.js Game Engine.  </p>

            <p>Here will be the Canvas based game, I don't know what I want to do at this point... maybe make a simple side scrolling platformer... a minimum viable product example.  Wish me luck!</p>
                <p>First Canvas example:</p>
                Comming Soon!

                <p>ok... so nothing as of right now... But, I do have a solid idea now! <br/>
                    the following image is a rough sketch of my aim (I am no artist)
                </p>
                <img src="images/Phasor-Game.png" style="width: 100%;padding: 0px;" />

                <p> the arrows show the basics for the physics involved. The idea is a
                    kind of paddle and ball game.  the ball will bounce on the paddle,
                    and the paddle will be draggable so that you can fling the ball
                    into the air.  there are three areas on the paddle on which you can
                    drag.  This is for me, since I currently don't know enough about
                    Phaser to know whether or not I can properly drag this paddle and
                    have it react the way I want it to react. </p>
            
            <p>The physics would probably be the first thing I will nail down.
                Once all the bouncing is finished, I will get the camera to focus
                on the ball.  This will be a kind of "see how high you can bounce
                the ball" game, to start.  I have some ideas for other things, but 
                for now, this is my minimum product for the weekend.</p>
            <p>To be continued...</p>

            <section>
                <p>
                    By development, I mean programming... so I am going to be researching into how to structure a phaser game.  I have found several examples on their examples page that I want to use as reference for my starting project. I will include links once I have figured out which ones I want to use.
                </p>
                
                <p>So here is the initial list:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="http://docs.phaser.io/" target="_blank">Phaser.io Documentation</a></li>
                    <li><a href="http://examples.phaser.io/_site/view_full.html?d=arcade%20physics&f=gravity.js&t=gravity" target="_blank">Example: gravity</a></li>
                    <li><a href="http://examples.phaser.io/_site/view_full.html?d=arcade%20physics&f=launcher+follow+world.js&t=launcher%20follow%20world" target="_blank">Example: Launching and camera follow.</a></li>
                    <li>and a little flair if I have time: <a href="http://examples.phaser.io/_site/view_full.html?d=particles&f=tweened+emitter.js&t=tweened%20emitter" target="_blank">Example Particle emitting trailing objects</a></li>
                    <li><a href="http://examples.phaser.io/_site/view_full.html?d=arcade%20physics&f=sprite+vs+sprite.js&t=sprite%20vs%20sprite" target="_blank">Example: two sprites colliding</a></li>
                </ul>
                
                Here we go... here is the first actual version. (if your currently seeing this... yea, it looks silly but its a small milestone.)

            <section> 
                <p>Well, that went well.  but its not as flexible as I need it to be.  most of the functionality that is in the ARCADE physics engine is very fast, yes, but not as dynamic as I envision. after more research I found that the P2 engine is more up my alley.  So I will attempt to keep the first project up and start on a new game system using the P2 engine.</p>
                <p> bellow are my new references:</p>
                <ul>
                <li><a href="http://examples.phaser.io/_site/view_full.html?d=p2%20physics&f=gravity.js&t=gravity" target="_blank">Example: Gravity</a></li>
                    <li><a href="http://examples.phaser.io/_site/view_full.html?d=p2%20physics&f=body+click.js&t=body%20click" target="_blank">Example: User Input</a></li>
                    <li><a href="http://examples.phaser.io/_site/view_full.html?d=p2%20physics&f=remove+spring.js&t=remove%20spring" target="_blank">Example: Springs and more Input</a></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Here is the next attempt at the same game, different physics engine:</p>
