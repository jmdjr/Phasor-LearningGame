            <h3>Welcome to JmdJR's First Phaser Game!</h3>
          
            <p> First let me point out... I <em>MISSPELLED</em> the engine's name when I generated this repository... my bad. </p>
            <p>This page will update periodically as I make some progress on a sample game using the Phaser.js Game Engine.  </p>
            Table of Contents:
            <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
                <li><a href="#Development-Concept">Development: Concept Contemplation</a></li>
                <li><a href="#Developent-beginning">Developent: The Beginning</a></li>
            </ul>
            <h3 id="Development-Concept">Development: Concept Contemplation</h3>

            <p>Here will be the Canvas based game, I don't know what I want to do at this point... maybe make a simple side scrolling platformer... a minimum viable product example.  Wish me luck!</p>
                <p>First Canvas example:</p>
                Comming Soon!

                <p>ok... so nothing as of right now... But, I do have a solid idea now! <br/>
                    the following image is a rough sketch of my aim (I am no artist)
                </p>
                <img src="images/Phasor-Game.png" style="width: 100%;padding: 0px;" />

                <p> the arrows show the basics for the physics involved. The idea is a
                    kind of paddle and ball game.  the ball will bounce on the paddle,
                    and the paddle will be draggable so that you can fling the ball
                    into the air.  there are three areas on the paddle on which you can
                    drag.  This is for me, since I currently don't know enough about
                    Phaser to know whether or not I can properly drag this paddle and
                    have it react the way I want it to react. </p>
            
            <p>The physics would probably be the first thing I will nail down.
                Once all the bouncing is finished, I will get the camera to focus
                on the ball.  This will be a kind of "see how high you can bounce
                the ball" game, to start.  I have some ideas for other things, but 
                for now, this is my minimum product for the weekend.</p>
            <p>To be continued...</p>

                <p>
                    By development, I mean programming... so I am going to be researching into how to structure a phaser game.  I have found several examples on their examples page that I want to use as reference for my starting project. I will include links once I have figured out which ones I want to use.
